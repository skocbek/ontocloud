# OntoCloud 

## Description
OntoCloud aims to visualize mappings between all BioPortal ontologies. Gephi is is used to produce visualization data and D3.js is used to visualize the data.

##TODO list:
* Recalculate shapes. User should be able to select which types of predicates are used to calculate shape values.
* Add additional shape information to shape pop-up window.
* Add additional functionality to “custom graph” mode:
   - Remove a node from the graph.
   - Add nodes from the same community to the graph.
* Add information about number of mappings.
* Fix the issues.

## Known issues:
* When a custom graph is loaded and the shape mode is turned on, nodes are not attached to layout, so they cannot be dragged.
